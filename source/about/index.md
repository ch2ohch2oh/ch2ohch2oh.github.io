## Bio

I've started programming since middle school and my first
programming language is QBasic. I am trained as a physicist
but I am an educated man in computer science.

I have experience in web development (react, django, flask, spring boot)
as well as machine learnig and data analytics (pandas suite, tf, pytorch).

## Education

- PhD (in progress) in particle physics from University of Florida <br/>
  I work on experimental data analysis on the Belle (II) experiment.
- BS in condensed matter physics from University of Science and Technology of China.<br/>
  I grew thin film, single crystal and tested them
  with XRD, Raman spectroscopy etc. Later I did MC simulation
  of laser cooling.

## Misc

I love classical music. Chopin and Listz are my favorites.
I play keyboard and sometimes try to arrange some music (piano accompaniment),
but apparently my talent is not there.

I do not want my car to break (again) but I love fixing cars,
among stuff.

I think Dr Pepper is better than cherry Coke.
